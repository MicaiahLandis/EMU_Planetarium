'# EMU Planetarium CANbus breakout pcb

  This pcb is designed to connect to a Adafruit CANbus RP2040 and breakout the GPIO pins to multiple JST connectors. The board has plugs for two stepper controllers and two breakbeams. 
  
  It also has input and passthrough plugs for canbus H and L as well as 24V supply.

  The remaing GPIO pins from the RP2040 are routed to extra mounting holes as spares. Aditionally there are two spare two pin 5V and GND JST Connectors
