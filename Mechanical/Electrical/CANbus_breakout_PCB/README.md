# EMU Planetarium CANbus Breakout PCB

## Overview

This PCB is designed to connect to an Adafruit CANbus RP2040 and break out the GPIO pins to multiple JST connectors. It includes connectors for:
- **Two stepper controllers**
- **Two breakbeams**

The board provides input and passthrough plugs for CANbus H and L, as well as a 24V power supply connection. Remaining GPIO pins from the RP2040 are routed to extra mounting holes as spares. Additionally, there are two spare two-pin 5V and GND JST connectors.

## Pinout

- **J1-J15**: Pin definitions (Add detailed information for each pin here if applicable)
